TrinityTrack6000 is a custom-built, multi-MCU remote-controlled tank constructed from 2 mm and 3 mm steel sheets. The system runs on a custom PCB integrating STM32, Infineon, and AVR microcontrollers, designed from scratch with fully deterministic memory allocation and task management.

The project leverages **ThreadX RTOS** on the STM32 for high-level coordination and **Micrium ÂµC/OS RTOS** on the Infineon MCU for precise motor and servo control. The AVR MCU functions as an IÂ²C slave for reading data from 1-Wire temperature sensors, allowing time-critical acquisition without blocking main task execution.

All tasks on STM32 and Infineon MCUs are allocated with **guard zones** in RAM, using custom **linker scripts** to arrange task stacks and guard areas contiguously. This setup enables continuous memory monitoring and deterministic stack overflow detection, fully compatible with static memory allocation principles.

The project is developed according to **MISRA C:2025** standards, ensuring safe, maintainable, and portable code. The system includes robust diagnostics and fault-handling mechanisms, including monitoring of RAM and CPU usage, task stack overflows, and EEPROM-based error logging.

Powering the tank is a **custom-designed switching power supply**, built from scratch to provide stable and reliable voltage for all MCUs and high-current peripherals.

> ðŸ”§ Status: Planned / Project in preparation  
> ðŸ§ª Goal: Serve as a futuristic, educational platform for learning **STM32**, **Infineon MCUs**, and real-time operating systems **ThreadX** and **Micrium ÂµC/OS**, while exploring multi-MCU coordination and embedded system design
