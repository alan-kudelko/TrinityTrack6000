TrinityTrack6000 is a custom-built, multi-MCU remote-controlled tank constructed from 2 mm and 3 mm steel sheets. The system runs on a custom PCB integrating STM32, Infineon, and AVR microcontrollers, designed from scratch with fully deterministic memory allocation and task management.

The project leverages **ThreadX RTOS** on the STM32 for high-level coordination and **Micrium µC/OS RTOS** on the Infineon MCU for precise motor and servo control. The AVR MCU functions as an I²C slave for reading data from 1-Wire temperature sensors, allowing time-critical acquisition without blocking main task execution.

All tasks on STM32 and Infineon MCUs are allocated with **guard zones** in RAM, using custom **linker scripts** to arrange task stacks and guard areas contiguously. This setup enables continuous memory monitoring and deterministic stack overflow detection, fully compatible with static memory allocation principles.

The project is developed according to **MISRA C:2025** standards, ensuring safe, maintainable, and portable code. The system includes robust diagnostics and fault-handling mechanisms, including monitoring of RAM and CPU usage, task stack overflows, and EEPROM-based error logging.

Powering the tank is a **custom-designed switching power supply**, built from scratch to provide stable and reliable voltage for all MCUs and high-current peripherals.

> 🔧 Status: Planned after finishing DrinkCreator6000  
> 🧪 Goal: Serve as a futuristic, educational platform for learning **STM32**, **Infineon MCUs**, and real-time operating systems **ThreadX** and **Micrium µC/OS**, while exploring multi-MCU coordination and embedded system design

## 5. STM32G473CET6

### 5.7. 💾 Memory Layout

#### 5.7.1 RAM Map

This section provides a detailed description of the memory sections and their roles within the project. It covers the organization of all RAM banks (RAM1, RAM2, and CCSRAM), custom linker-defined sections, and their purpose in task management, memory diagnostics, and system operation.

![STM32G473_RAM_MAP](Media/STM32G473_RAM_MAP.png)

#### 5.7.1.1 RAM1
- `__DATA_start__` is a custom linker symbol representing the starting address of the `.data` section in RAM1 on STM32G473CET6
- `__DATA_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the `.data` section in RAM1 on STM32G473CET6
- `__BSS_start__` is a custom linker symbol representing the starting address of the `.bss` section in RAM1 on STM32G473CET6
- `__BSS_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the `.bss` section in RAM1 on STM32G473CET6
- `__TDAT_start__` is a custom linker symbol representing the starting address of the `.tdat` section in RAM1 on STM32G473CET6
- `__TDAT_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the `.tdat` section in RAM1 on STM32G473CET6
- `ramDiagnosticsRAM1_lastHeapEnd` is a C variable defined by me to represent the current end of the heap. Its value is calculated at runtime (see Notes below).
- `ramDiagnosticsRAM1_lastMSP` is a C variable defined by me to capture the last value of the main stack pointer before the RTOS scheduler starts (see Notes below).
- `__RAM1_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the last address of RAM1 on STM32G473CET6

*RAM1 notes:*
- The `.tdat` section is a custom linker-defined memory segment used to store non-critical or rarely used Task Control Blocks (TCBs), their stacks, and associated guard zones. By placing these stacks contiguously within `.tdat`, the system ensures controlled allocation and simplifies stack overflow detection for non-critical tasks.
- The symbols `__TDAT_start__` and `__TDAT_end__` were predefined in the linker script, along with a custom `.tdat` section. This section is used to store Task Control Blocks (TCBs), task stacks, and corresponding guard zones. The `.tdat` section ensures that stacks and their guard zones are placed contiguously in memory, enabling reliable stack overflow monitoring.
- The `ramDiagnosticsRAM1_lastHeapEnd` variable is computed as:
  
      ramDiagnosticsRAM1_lastHeapEnd = (__sbrk_heap_end != NULL) ? __sbrk_heap_end : (void*)&__TDAT_end__;
  
  Here, `__sbrk_heap_end` is a pointer managed by the STM32's custom implementation of `_sbrk`, indicating the current top of the heap. If no memory has been allocated yet, it remains `NULL`.
- The `ramDiagnosticsRAM1_lastMSP` variable captures the value of the main stack pointer (`MSP`) before the RTOS scheduler starts. After the scheduler starts, `MSP` is switched to the currently running task's stack pointer, which would make direct free memory calculations invalid if used afterward.

#### 5.7.1.2 RAM2
- `__RAM_DIAGNOSTICS_start__` is a custom linker symbol representing the starting address of the `.ramDiagnostics` section in RAM2
- `__RAM_DIAGNOSTICS_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the `.ramDiagnostics` section in RAM2
- `__SYS_DIAGNOSTICS_start__` is a custom linker symbol representing the starting address of the `.sysDiag` section in RAM2
- `__SYS_DIAGNOSTICS_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the `.sysDiag` section in RAM2
- `__RAM2_end` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the RAM2 on STM32G473CET6

*RAM2 notes:*
- The `.ramDiagnostics` section stores variables related to memory usage and diagnostics of the RAM state. These variables are not time-critical, allowing them to reside in RAM2, which has slower access compared to other RAM regions.
- The `.sysDiag` section is used for storing global error flags and other system diagnostics that are also not time-critical.
- Access to RAM2 is slower compared to other RAM regions, making it suitable for non-time-critical data storage.

#### 5.7.1.3 CCSRAM
- `__CRIT_start__` is a custom linker symbol representing the starting address of the `.crit` section in CCSRAM
- `__CRIT_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the `.crit` section in CCSRAM
- `__CCSRAM_end__` is a custom linker symbol representing the ending address of the CCSRAM on STM32G473CET6

*CCSRAM notes:*
- The `.crit` section (located in CCSRAM) stores TCBs, stacks, guard zones, and buffers for critical or frequently executed tasks, ensuring maximum performance and predictability.
- CCSRAM is tightly coupled with the CPU core, providing the fastest access compared to other RAM regions on STM32G473, making it ideal for time-critical data and task management.

#### 5.7.2 Custom RAM Segments

The default linker script generated by STM32CubeIDE only includes sections for the RAM1 bank and the minimal sections required for basic programs to run on the STM32.  

To fully utilize the available memory and support advanced features such as runtime memory diagnostics and critical task management, the linker script was modified. Additional RAM banks (RAM2 and CCSRAM) and custom memory sections were added, including `.tdat`, `.crit`, `.ramDiagnostics`, and `.sysDiag`, allowing fine-grained control over task stacks, guard zones, and system diagnostics.


#### 5.7.3 Free Memory Calculation

Free memory is calculated separately for each RAM bank (RAM1, RAM2, and CCSRAM) based on linker symbols and runtime diagnostics variables.
- `ramDiagnosticsRAM1_used` calculates the memory used in RAM1, including the main stack (MSP) before the RTOS scheduler starts and the heap usage
- `ramDiagnosticsRAM2_used` calculates the memory occupied by sections in RAM2
- `ramDiagnosticsCCSRAM_used` calculates the memory occupied by the sections in CCSRAM

All used memory values are expressed in **kilobytes (kB)**:

    ramDiagnosticsRAM1_used=(((uint32_t)&__RAM1_end__ - ramDiagnosticsRAM1_lastMSP) + (ramDiagnosticsRAM1_lastHeapEnd - (uint32_t)&__RAM1_start__))/1024;
    ramDiagnosticsRAM2_used=((uint32_t)&__RAM_DIAGNOSTICS_end__ - (uint32_t)&__RAM2_start__)/1024;
 	ramDiagnosticsCCSRAM_used=((uint32_t)&__CRIT_end__ - (uint32_t)&__CCSRAM_start__)/1024;
    ramDiagnosticsGeneral_used = ramDiagnosticsRAM1_used + ramDiagnosticsRAM2_used + ramDiagnosticsCCSRAM_used;

The free memory for each RAM bank and the overall system is then calculated by subtracting the used memory from the total size of the corresponding memory region:

    ramDiagnosticsRAM1_total_size - ramDiagnosticsRAM1_used
    ramDiagnosticsRAM2_total_size - ramDiagnosticsRAM2_used
    ramDiagnosticsCCSRAM_total_size - ramDiagnosticsCCSRAM_used
    ramDiagnosticsGeneral_total_size - ramDiagnosticsGeneral_used

#### 5.7.4 RAM Usage Overview

(will be summarized after adding ThreadX and tasks to the project)

---

### 5.8 MCU Diagnostics

Diagnostics for the STM32G473CET6 microcontroller can be performed either via the **ST-LINK** interface in STM32CubeIDE or through a **UART** interface.

The diagnostics system provides real-time insight into:
- The current state of system tasks (Task Control Blocks, stack usage, and guard zones)
- RAM usage and memory status across all memory banks
- The most recent error codes and system fault flags

This enables developers and engineers to monitor system health, detect stack overflows, and analyze runtime behavior for both critical and non-critical tasks.

#### 5.8.1 ThreadX Tasks Diagnostics

(soon)

#### 5.8.2 RAM Usage Diagnostics

RAM usage diagnostics provide a detailed view of the memory sections for each RAM bank (RAM1, RAM2, and CCSRAM).  

This diagnostics functionality is accessible via the **UART interface**, allowing real-time monitoring of:
- Memory usage per section
- Free and used memory in kilobytes (kB)
- Task stack allocation and guard zones (for RAM1 and CCSRAM)

This diagnostics functionality is accessible via the **UART interface** and consists of:
- A **main menu** summarizing all RAM banks and their overall usage
- Detailed views for each individual RAM bank, showing section-specific memory usage, free and used memory in kilobytes (kB), and task stack allocation with guard zones (for RAM1 and CCSRAM)

The diagnostics interface is structured similarly to the diagrams below, providing an intuitive visualization of memory allocation and usage.

      +-------------------------[ RAM DIAGNOSTICS ]--------------------------+

### 8.0 Tank Dimensions and weight

| Dimension    |         |
|--------------|---------|
| $Length$     | 70 [cm] |
| $Width_{1}$  | 32 [cm] |
| $Width_{2}$  | 42 [cm] |
| $Height$     | 20 [cm] |
| $Ground\ clearance$ | 5 [cm] |
| $Weight$     | 25 [kg] |

###### $Width_{1}$ - Width of tank without tracks  
###### $Width_{2}$ - Width of tank with tracks  

Speed of the tank has to be at least $V_{Max}=5\frac{km}{h}$

### 8.1 Tank Body Overview

### 8.2 Drive Train Components

#### 8.2.1 Tracks and Sprocket Wheels

#### 8.2.2 DC Motors

The selected DC motors are Injora 540 13T models. They were chosen primarily due to their low cost and relatively high peak power output of up to 300 W.  
The main drawback of these motors is their high RPM, which requires the use of a reduction gearbox to achieve suitable torque and speed for the application.

![Tank Tracks](Media/Injora540_Parameters_Comparison.png)
![Tank Tracks](Media/DC_Motor_Selection.png)

The performance graphs were generated in **MATLAB** based on the manufacturer’s specifications and the fundamental DC motor equations.  

According to these graphs, the Injora 540 13T motor reaches a peak power of around **300 W**, but its RPM is too high for practical use in an RC tank. In order to move a heavy vehicle, a reduction gearbox is required to convert the excessive RPM into usable torque.


#### 8.2.3 Reduction Gearbox

| Drivetrain parameters    |         |
|--------------|---------|
| Sprocket wheel diameter     | D=48 [mm] |
| Motor RPM  | n=32500 [rpm] |
| Gearbox reduction  ratio | r=1:50 |

![Tank Tracks](Media/DC_Motor_Gearbox_1_50.png)
![Tank Tracks](Media/DC_Motor_Gearbox_dims_1.png)
![Tank Tracks](Media/DC_Motor_Gearbox_dims_2.png)
![Tank Tracks](Media/DC_Motor_Gearbox_Selection.png)

With the selected **DC motor** and **1:50 reduction gearbox**, the theoretical sprocket speed is:  

\[
n_{out} = \frac{n}{r} = \frac{32500}{50} \approx 650 \ \text{rpm}
\]

Using formula (1), we can calculate the **maximum theoretical speed of the tank**:  

1)  
\[
V_{max} = \pi \cdot \frac{D \cdot n_{out}}{60}
\]

\[
V_{max} = \pi \cdot \frac{0.048 \cdot 650}{60} \approx 1.63 \ \text{m/s} \approx 5.88 \ \text{km/h}
\]
